# Flower-Recognition
The Flower Recognition Project is a machine learning-based system that automatically identifies different species of flowers from images. By training classification models on large datasets, the project teaches algorithms to recognize patterns such as petal shapes, colors, and textures. Using techniques like feature extraction and supervised learning, the system can accurately predict the type of flower shown in a photo. This project demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in image classification and has applications in education, gardening, research, and conservation.
